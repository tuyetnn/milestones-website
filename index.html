<h2><div class="content-box">How the world wide web started? </div></h2>
<p> Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist. He was born on June 8,1955 in London.
  After graduating from Oxford University, Berners-Lee became a software engineer at CERN Institute of Gevena, Switzerland.
  In 1989, he and his collegues began to introduce their invention to the world called "The world wide web"
  and published it in March. The world wide web is a system of hyperlink and hypertext documents accessed through the Internet.
  The purpose of this program was to make information readily accessible to the users.
   So they could sharing their idea and communicates with each other.

<h3> <div class="content-box"> The First Digital Computer Invented. </h3></div>
<p>  John Vincent Atanasoff, an American mathematician, and physicist. In 1937,
   he and his graduate student, Cliff Berry started to discover and develop the first
   digital computer until 1942 at the Iowa State College. This was the first computer
    can store information on its main memory and it was the size of a big
   desk weighed 750 pounds and featured rotating drums for memory, glowing vacuum tubes.

   <h4><div class="content-box"> The Invention Of The First portable (Laptop). </h4></div>
   <p> In 1981, Adam Osborne, an ex-book publisher who came up with the idea for
     the first truly portable. The portable or usually be described as a luggable.
      It is a combination of all component, inputs, outputs and can easily transport
      from one location to another. At that time, it was cost over one thousand
     dollars and it had a tiny computer screen with it and weighed is about 12 kg.
   However, as we compare to the portable in this modern time, also known as a laptop.
 Today, a laptop has became to be one of the technology that most people know how to using it. </p>

<h5><div class="content-box"> The First Apple's Computer.</h5></div>
<p> In 1977, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were introduced the first Apple's computer
   which called "Apple I". It contained completely assembled circuit board with around 30 chips. It also
    allows users to interact with visual icons. Base on this innovation, today there
     are many computers have had invented with the best features such as big screen,
      more memory, and storage which helps peole to retain the large amounts of data.
    engineers  still developing and discovering to make the computer more accessible to use.</p>
